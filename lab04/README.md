# Lab 04 - Frontend and Backend

This folder contains the completed Lab 4 playlist implementation based on the supplied student sheet. The Python backend validates and stores songs in memory, and the HTML/JavaScript frontend reads and adds songs through the `/songs` API.

## Setup

1. Extract `lab04_starter.zip`. Copy the five files inside its `lab04` folder
   into `ai1220/lab04/` in your existing private repository. Include `.gitignore`.
   If that folder already has work, review it before copying over files.
2. Keep `backend.py` and `index.html` together. Use Python 3.10 or newer and a
   browser; no extra Python packages, API key, or purchase are needed.
3. Follow the desktop-app setup on page 1 of the student sheet. Use
   `ai1220/lab04` as the working folder in a Local chat.
4. Open a terminal in `lab04/` and run:

   ```bash
   python3 backend.py
   ```

   On Windows, use `py backend.py`.
5. Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>. The initial list should show
   **First Light / Demo Band**. Keep the server terminal open.

Use `Ctrl+C` to stop. Restart after Python edits; refresh after HTML edits.
Restarting resets the playlist to the seed song. Valid additions return `201 Created`; invalid additions return `400 Bad Request` with a JSON error message.

## Files

| File | Starter role / remaining work |
| --- | --- |
| `backend.py` | HTTP server, seed data, and completed `create_song(payload)` validation/storage logic. |
| `index.html` | Page, form, display logic, `My playlist` heading, and completed `sendSong(title, artist)`. |
| `REPORT.md` | Fill in your name, explanations, commit details, and actual observations. |
| `README.md` | Setup, task checklist, contract, and checks. |
| `.gitignore` | Ignore local Python cache and virtual-environment files. |

## API contract to implement

| Request | Required result after completion |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` | The browser page. Already supplied. |
| `GET /songs` | 200 and a JSON list of stored songs in insertion order. Already supplied. |
| `POST /songs` | A JSON object containing `title` and `artist`; return 201 and the stored song with its server-assigned integer `id`. |
| Invalid addition | 400 and `{"error": "a helpful message"}`; leave the playlist and next ID unchanged. |

- Both fields must be strings and must be present.
- Remove surrounding whitespace; each trimmed field must have 1-80 characters.
- Store trimmed values and ignore extra fields. Duplicate titles are allowed.
- IDs start at 1 and increase by one for each accepted addition. The seed uses
  ID 1, so the first successful addition uses ID 2.
- JSON requests and replies use `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Data is kept in memory only. The supplied HTTP setup handles malformed JSON,
  non-object bodies, and unknown paths.

## Exercise 1 - Explore and make a commit (15%)

- [ ] Ask for the working folder and Git repository root. Confirm `lab04` and
  the existing `ai1220` repository.
- [ ] Ask how the two code files work together, without changing files yet.
- [ ] Run the starter and inspect the seed song.
- [ ] Enter your name in `REPORT.md` and inspect that change.
- [ ] In your existing repository, commit only `lab04/REPORT.md` with the
  message `Start lab04 report`. Preserve unrelated changes and staging.
  Do not push yet.
- [ ] Verify the commit hash and that the only included file is
  `lab04/REPORT.md`. Record the hash and what was saved in the report.
- [ ] Explain ownership of the playlist, display of the page, and initial song
  loading in your own words. Record any access issue and instructor support.

## Exercise 2 - Complete the Python backend (35%)

- [ ] Complete only `create_song(payload)` in `backend.py`, following its
  docstring and the contract above. Keep the supplied HTTP setup.
- [ ] Restart the server after saving.
- [ ] Check one accepted and one rejected direct request before continuing.
- [ ] Record what actually happened in `REPORT.md`.

## Exercise 3 - Connect the frontend (30%)

- [ ] Change the visible page heading to `My playlist`.
- [ ] Complete only `sendSong(title, artist)`. Send the supplied form values
  as JSON to `POST /songs` using `requestJSON`, and return the helper's result.
- [ ] Ask for an explanation of how the changes match the contract.
- [ ] Refresh and check that an accepted song appears once and clears the inputs.
- [ ] Check that a rejected addition shows an error, keeps the inputs, and
  leaves the displayed list unchanged.
- [ ] Confirm that the displayed songs match the server's stored data.

## Exercise 4 - Verify and explain (20%)

Perform the page 3 checks after completing the marked code. Record actual
observations in `REPORT.md`; the expected results below are not evidence.
Use invented song data. The curl commands work in macOS/Linux shells and
Windows Git Bash. Use a second terminal while the server is running.

- [ ] Restart. The page and this request should show only the seed song, ID 1:

  ```bash
  curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/songs
  ```

- [ ] In the form, add `Blue Sky` / `Test Duo`. It should appear once and the
  fields should clear. Refresh: both songs should remain. Add another invented
  song with different values.
- [ ] Add a song directly. Expect 201, trimmed values, and the next unused ID.
  Refresh the page and confirm it appears:

  ```bash
  curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/songs \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"title":"  Quiet Road  ","artist":"Sample Artist"}'
  ```

- [ ] Send invalid input. Expect 400, a helpful error, and no new song:

  ```bash
  curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/songs \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"title":"   ","artist":"Sample Artist"}'
  ```

- [ ] Also check a missing artist, a numeric title, and an 81-character title.
  Check that an 80-character title succeeds. Rejected requests must not
  consume an ID. Both title and artist must follow the same validation rules.
- [ ] Submit spaces as the title and a nonempty artist through the form.
  Confirm that the error is visible, the inputs remain, and the list does not
  change. Correct the title and submit successfully. Check Tab and Enter.
- [ ] In browser Developer Tools > Network, inspect a successful `POST /songs`
  payload, status 201, and JSON response, then the following `GET /songs`.
- [ ] Restart and refresh; confirm that only the seed song remains.
- [ ] Record one successful and one failed request/response, explain one code
  change you reviewed, and prepare to explain both completed functions.

## Finish the lab

- [ ] Keep the five required files in `ai1220/lab04/`.
- [ ] Review and commit the remaining changes in those files with the message
  `Complete lab04 playlist`, preserving other work.
- [ ] Use your existing terminal workflow to run `git push` from the repository
  root before the session ends, then verify the files on GitHub.
- [ ] Optional stretch (ungraded): display the number of songs and check it
  stays correct after additions and refreshes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Cannot open the page | Keep the server running and use the exact HTTP URL above. |
| Port 8000 is in use | Stop your earlier lab server with Ctrl+C; ask for help if it is another process. |
| Changes are not visible | Save the file, then restart Python or refresh the browser as appropriate. |
| "Not implemented" | Complete the relevant marked function; this is expected in the starter. |
